# Archontes
 
This is a remake of an old C64 game called Archon.
You are on a board similar to chess and there are 2 factions, light and dark.
Each has its own pieces, each with special skills and abilities.
The goal is to capture the 5 control points or to kill every other piece.

This version is made with Unity 2021.3 URP.
